# The Odin Project's Connect Four

Connect Four is a 2 player game where each player takes a turn to insert their "circle" into a column. A player can win if they have 4 consecutive circles in a row, column or diagonal. For this particular implementation, Player 1 plays with a blue circle and Player 2 plays with a yellow circle. 

The implementation of this project was done with Test-Driven Development (TDD) where tests were written first before writing their corresponding method.
